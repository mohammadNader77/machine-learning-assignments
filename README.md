## Assignment #2: Regression Analysis and Model Selection

**Objective:**  
In this project, we build and evaluate linear and nonlinear regression models to predict car prices using the YallaMotors dataset.

### Tasks:
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding features, and normalizing data.
- Building regression models (Linear, LASSO, Ridge, Polynomial, and RBF).
- Model selection and evaluation using MSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- Feature selection using forward selection.
- Regularization using LASSO and Ridge.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.
- Final model evaluation on test set.

## Assignment #3: KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Kernel Methods, and Ensemble Methods

**Objective:**  
This assignment involves implementing and evaluating classification algorithms including KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and ensemble methods (Boosting and Bagging).

### Tasks:
- **KNN:** Experiment with different distance metrics and determine the optimal value of K.
- **Logistic Regression:** Train a model with different regularization techniques and evaluate its performance.
- **SVM:** Implement SVM with multiple kernels and analyze the impact of different kernels.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Use AdaBoost and Random Forest, and compare their performance to individual models.
